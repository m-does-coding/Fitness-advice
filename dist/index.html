  <h1>Progression</h1>

  <p>Going to the gym is a passion of mine because <em>challenging</em> myself every week with more reps or adding weight and seeing my progress gives me joy. For someone looking to start their journey at the gym give:

  <ul>
    <li>Progressive overload a go </li>
    <li>Be consistent!</li>
    <li>More steps</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>workout split</h2>

  <p>I do currently do <strong>push,pull,legs</strong> split twice a week and suggest for beginners or even someone returning to the gym to find a program and be consistent.

  <h3>nutrition</h3>
  <p>I have recently figured out I need to <em>fuel</em> my body with even more protein but also carbs, fibre and healthy fats.

    For someone looking to change their nutrition based on their <strong>goal</strong>, I would recommend:

  <ol>
    <li>Finding out their activity level
      speaking to a <em>health professional about making changes.</em> </li>
    <li>Having more or less calories while getting the right amount of protein, carb, fats and fibre.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
